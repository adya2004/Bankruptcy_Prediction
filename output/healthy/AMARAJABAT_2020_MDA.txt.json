    "summary": "Amara Raja Batteries Limited, a leading manufacturer of lead-acid batteries in India, faced a challenging year in 2019-20 due to the global economic downturn and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the company put up a healthy show, with a strong distribution network and a wide range of products. The Indian economy slowed down in sync with the global economic turmoil, with a growth rate of 4.2% in 2019-20, and the lead-acid battery market is expected to de-grow in FY21 due to the COVID-19 impact. However, the company is well-positioned to rebound, with a strong foundation and a diversified product portfolio. The bankruptcy level of the company is -1, indicating a healthy company.",
