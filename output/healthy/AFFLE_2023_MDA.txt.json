    "summary": "The global economy faced severe headwinds in 2022 due to surging commodity prices and supply disruptions, but has begun to show early signs of stabilization and improvement in 2023. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to contribute 70% of global growth in 2023, with India and China projected to contribute over half of the world's growth. The digital economy is expected to reach USD 1 trillion by 2030, driven by government initiatives to promote digitization and affordable data plans. However, the company Affle (India) Limited is not mentioned to be in a critical situation, and thus the bankruptcy level is -1.",
