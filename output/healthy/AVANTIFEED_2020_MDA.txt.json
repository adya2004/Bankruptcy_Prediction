    "summary": "Avanti Feeds Limited is a pioneer in the Indian shrimp industry with over 26 years of experience. The company has a strong dealership network and provides technical assistance to farmers. However, the aquaculture industry is dependent on climatic conditions and natural calamities, which can have a serious impact on the prospects of successful culture. Despite this, the company has shown resilience and has achieved record shrimp production. The company's financial performance has been good, with a profit of \u20b93763.75 crores before tax adjustments. However, the company's power projects have faced challenges, including limited power generation due to non-availability of gas. The company has a proper internal control system in place to ensure that all assets are safeguarded and protected against loss. The company's bankruptcy level is -1, indicating that it is a healthy company.",
