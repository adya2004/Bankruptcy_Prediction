    "summary": "The global economy experienced a slowdown in 2019, with the Indian economy growing at an 11-year low of 4.2% in FY2019-20. The sugar industry also faced challenges, with global sugar production estimated to fall to around 175.1 million tonnes. However, the Indian government introduced initiatives to support the industry, including a reduction in corporate tax rates and an increase in the minimum selling price of sugar. Despite these challenges, Balrampur Chini Mills Limited reported revenues of C4513.11 crore in 2019-20, with sugar accounting for 77.78% of overall revenues. The company's bankruptcy level is -1, indicating a healthy financial status.",
