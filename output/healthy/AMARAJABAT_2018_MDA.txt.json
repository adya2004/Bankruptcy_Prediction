    "summary": "The global economy experienced a growth rate of 3.8% in 2017, driven by an investment recovery in advanced economies and strong growth in emerging Asia. India's economy also experienced a growth rate of 6.7% in 2017-18, despite disruptions caused by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and demonetization. The Indian battery market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.36% during 2017-2022, driven by the increasing demand for lead-acid batteries in the automotive and industrial sectors.
