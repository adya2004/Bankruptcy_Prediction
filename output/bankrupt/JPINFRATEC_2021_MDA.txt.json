    "summary": "Jaypee Infratech Limited is undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) and its affairs, business and assets are being managed by Mr. Anuj Jain, the Interim Resolution Professional. The company's revenue from Toll Collection for the year ended 31st March, 2021 aggregated to Rs 334.18 crores as compared to Rs 337.72 Crores for the corresponding previous year ended 31st March, 2020. The decline in toll collection had been primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic lock-down imposed by union Government throughout the country. The company's financial performance for the year 2020-21 was affected by the CIRP and the resultant loss for the year under reference. The company's future prospects are dependent on the successful completion of the CIRP and the implementation of the Resolution Plan. The company's bankruptcy level is 0.6 due to the negative impact of the CIRP and the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial performance.",
