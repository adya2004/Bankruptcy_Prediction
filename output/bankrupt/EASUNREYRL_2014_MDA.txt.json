    "summary": "The company's growth was affected by many factors like volatility in commodity prices, exchange cost, higher interest cost, etc. The uncertain macro-economic environment also affected the company, especially in the power sector. Despite the challenges, the company's subsidiaries have shown positive and satisfactory turnover. The company has also made inroads in a number of export markets and has raised paid up capital through a fund raising exercise. However, the company's financial position is critical due to high project cost and delay in payments, and the company is taking efforts to improve margins by increasing efficiency and selecting orders with good margins.",
