    "summary": "ABG Shipyard Limited's annual report for 2012-2013 highlights the challenging year for the global and Indian economy. The company's financial year was marked by a low growth rate of 5-5.5%, and the industrial sector continued to reel under a severe slowdown. However, the company's long-term prospects remain bright, given the favorable demographics and the directional commitment towards liberalization. The Indian government has been supportive of the shipbuilding industry, and the company is likely to benefit from the government's initiatives to develop ancillary units for the shipbuilding sector. The company's bankruptcy level is -1, indicating a healthy company.",
