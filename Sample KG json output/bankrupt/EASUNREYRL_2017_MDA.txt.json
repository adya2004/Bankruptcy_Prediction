    "summary": "The company's financial performance has been negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and poor cash flow in the power generation, industry, and infrastructure sectors. However, the government's initiatives to energize the power sector, such as the UDAY Scheme and amendments to the National Tariff Policy, are expected to improve market conditions. The company's revenue from operations has decreased, and it has incurred a net loss due to slow collection from projects and government sector undertakings. The company's internal control systems are in place, and it has an internal audit function that reports to the audit committee. The company's financial status is critical, and its future prospects are uncertain.",
